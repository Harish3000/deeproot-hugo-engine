    content: "These sessions felt very different from typical tech talks. The focus on real-world engineering decisions and architectural thinking helped me see software engineering from a much broader and more mature perspective."

  - name: "Sam Sen"
    designation: "Software Engineering Intern"
    avatar: "/images/avatar-sm.png"
    content: "DeepRoot helped me slow down and think clearly about problems before coding. Understanding the reasoning behind design choices made complex topics feel structured and logical instead of overwhelming."

  - name: "Sanker"
    designation: "Undergraduate Software Engineer"
    avatar: "/images/avatar-sm.png"
    content: "The sessions emphasized thinking like an engineer rather than just following patterns. DeepRoot helped me connect fundamentals with real-world systems and improved how I reason about scalability and design."
